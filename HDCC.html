                    <p class="text">
                        At the main stage we hold the cosplay competition, Cosplay catwalk,
                        and have interviews </p>

                    <p>with the guests we invited! Don’t forget that if you
                        wish to participate in either of the cosplay activities here you must sign in
                        ahead of time! The 2 rules for the competition are that atleast 80% of your cosplay
                        is selfmade, and that you have loads of fun, regardless who wins!
                    </p>

                    <p class="texts">The only important thing for the catcalk is that
                        you register on time, besides that you’re</p>
                    <p> allowed to go as any existing
                        character or even an original character that you created. </p>

                    <p class="texts">And at last but certainly not least, to watch the interviews
                        there’s no extra cost or registration needed. Just make sure to check at what
                        time the interview starts so that you don’t miss it!</p>

                        creations on sale. Whether you plan on spending money or not, do not skip this
                        alley because you can still just look around to admire others’ creativity and
                        passions for the arts.</p>

                        Every edition there are various builds and small musea at the convention that are about </p>
                    <p>Star Wars. Considering the Star Wars fandom is huge,
                        this has become an important</p>
                    <p>part of the event that absolutely CANNOT be left out. </p>

                    <p class="texts">Here you can take pictures with the impressive builds, and talk to the creators of
                        them.
                        The builds can vary from the a starship, cruiser or battleship, to the recreation of the of the
                        famous
                        robot: BB-8. It’s remote control, and thus able to move throughout it’s whole assigned area!
                    </p>



                    <p class="texts">There’s also a small part of musea where other works
                        get presented. Though just because </p>
                    <p>they’re not remote controlled, doesn’t mean they are less worthy! These creations tend to be on
                        display,
                        as well as on sale. Watch out though, because they go for very high prices,
                        considering the amount of time and effort was put into their creation! </p>

                        Of course we can’t leave out the Comics in a Comic Con!
                        We have tons of fun panels where you can sit back, and listen
                        to various talented professional Comic authors or artists.
                        They can explain the process of making a comic con or talk about
                        their own experiences working on them. </p>

                    <p class="texts">After the main program of the panel has been completed,
                        you also get a chance to ask them any remaining questions you’re still curious about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texts">There’s also many activities being held where teacher
                        will guide you through the comic making process. Here you get to
                        either show off your skills or learn new things from the teachers
                        and the already skilled attendees.
                    </p>

                    <p class="texts">For these activities it’s adviced to sign up before the Con,
                        because there might not always be a spot left not. Sometimes sign ups are
                        mandatory, and remember that some activities might come with a small fee!</p>
